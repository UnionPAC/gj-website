# My Personal Website

Hey, Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This is the repo for my personal website. A place where you can learn more about me, find some cool projects that i've been working on, check out some of my writing via my Medium blog, and more!

This is a living website, meaning that i'll be updating this as I go, and i'll probably create a section for 'What i'm doing now', which will have a few goals that i'm working towards, and what my current focuses are etc...

Thanks for checking this out,
See ya around!
