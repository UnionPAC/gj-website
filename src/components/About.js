          I went to school for business/finance, but after graduating realized
          that I was mostly interested in building and creating things! I built a
          startup called Koji Street, which was a marketplace for independent
          fashion designers and artists. I worked on that for about 1 1/2 years
          until I felt like I was hitting a wall I couldn't overcome. I realized
          my biggest issue in my last startup was my lack of technical ability
          to build out products/ services. So I decided to teach myself how to
          code. I first learned Web development and then decided that I wanted
          to be a builder in the CBW (Crypto, Blockchain and Web3) space because
          it was so innovative. I learned Solidity, hardhat and ethers.js in
          order to build smart contracts. So far, I have mainly built for EVM
          based chains like Ethereum testnets, mainnet, Polygon, etc... Right
          now I am focused on learning and building as much as possible in the
          CBW space because I want to be apart of building the future!
